00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Fridays are awesome. I'm Carl

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 azuz. This is CNN Student

3
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 News your daily 10-minute break

4
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 down of world events. We're

5
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 starting with news concerning Russia.

6
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 The world's largest country in

7
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 land area is building up

8
00:03:41.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 its military presence in the

9
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Black Sea Russia borders part

10
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 of this body of water.

11
00:04:31.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 It also controversially annexed Crimea

12
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 in 2014. The peninsula house

13
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 has a significant Russian sea

14
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 port in the Black Sea.

15
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Also in the region the

16
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 US has sent several F-22

17
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Raptor warplanes to Romania another

18
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 border country of the sea.

19
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 So what's the significance of

20
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 all this will relations between

21
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 the US and Russia are

22
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 at a low point and

23
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 America has been showing support

24
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 for its allies in the

25
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 region who were members of

26
00:08:41.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 NATO the North Atlantic Treaty

27
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Organization a group of countries

28
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 that banded together after World

29
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 War Two to balance out

30
00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 the Military strength of the

31
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Soviet Union. So a military

32
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 buildup in the Black Sea

33
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 is like an international show

34
00:10:51.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 of power. The Black Sea

35
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 has become one of the

36
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 most hotly contested and heavily

37
00:12:40.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 militarized regions. This is not

38
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 a new phenomenon for hundreds

39
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 of years. Russia has seen

40
00:13:41.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 the Black Sea as strategically

41
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 vital and if you take

42
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 a look at a map,

43
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 it's not hard to see

44
00:14:40.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 why this black sea is

45
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 so strategically valuable to Russia

46
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 firstly it acts essentially as

47
00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 a bridge between two continents

48
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 a Gateway between Europe and

49
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 the Middle East and it

50
00:16:41.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 also provides crucial access to

51
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 the Mediterranean and two oceans

52
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 beyond that gives it value

53
00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 commercially, but also gives it

54
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 importance militarily and if you

55
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 take a look at the

56
00:18:40.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 conflict in Syria, you can

57
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 see that the Black Sea

58
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 provides a vital strategic and

59
00:19:41.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Logistics Hub to the Russians

60
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 who are carrying out Military

61
00:20:31.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 activities in that conflict there.

62
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Now, if you also take

63
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 a look at the other

64
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 countries that are bordering the

65
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Black Sea, it'll help you.

66
00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 The situation a little bit

67
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 better, Ukraine, Romania Bulgaria, Georgia

68
00:22:41.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 and turkey with the exception

69
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 of turkey all of them

70
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 were either Soviet States or

71
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 part of the Soviet Bloc

72
00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and with Georgia and Ukraine

73
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 aspiring to move closer to

74
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Nato. Russia is increasingly surrounded

75
00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 by treaty allies. Russia has

76
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 said again and again that

77
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 it strongly believes that former

78
00:25:41.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Soviet republics should remain under

79
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 the Russian sphere of influence

80
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 and it is also been

81
00:26:40.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 complaining for decades about what

82
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 it calls NATO aggression essentially

83
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 that Western Alliance, which it

84
00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 sees as pushing up aggressively

85
00:28:20.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 against Russia's borders. Okay. Now

86
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 we're diving deeper International Maritime

87
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 tensions aren't limited to the

88
00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Black Sea we've reported on

89
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 China's controversial buildup of man-made

90
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 islands in the South China

91
00:30:41.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Sea. The u.s. Is reportedly

92
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 planning to use submarine drones

93
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 to help keep tabs on

94
00:31:40.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 that region and American officials

95
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 say that Russian submarine activity

96
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 is at levels that the

97
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 u.s. Navy hasn't seen in

98
00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 decades. Russia has increased its

99
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Patrols in the Atlantic including

100
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 in areas near us Waters.

101
00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 So the American Military is

102
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 trying to keep its upper

103
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 hand by developing Subs like

104
00:34:31.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 the USS, Missouri and CNN

105
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 recently got the chance to

106
00:35:10.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 climb aboard. This is a

107
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 very important time for submarine

108
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 operation their way of projecting

109
00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 power across the planet really

110
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 silently is called the silent

111
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 service their job is to

112
00:37:41.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 hide really so no one

113
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 knows where they are. I'm

114
00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 standing on the bridge of

115
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 the USS Missouri. It's a

116
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 nuclear attack submarine. So rare

117
00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 visit really one of the

118
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 most incredible things I've ever

119
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 done as a reporter. We're

120
00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 going to show you what

121
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 it is like to live

122
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 and work on board here

123
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 where people sleep where they

124
00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 eat where they do their

125
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 jobs dangerous job at times

126
00:43:40.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 lot boy, the world is

127
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 is as quite a proliferation

128
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 of submarines and the best

129
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 way right now to find

130
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 another submarine is with a

131
00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 submarine the bad guys whoever

132
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 they are have to assume

133
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 that there's a sub within

134
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 range if they were to

135
00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 do anything is that the

136
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 stealth is clearly without stealth

137
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 a submarine could not do

138
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 the missions. It does we

139
00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 were operating places where we

140
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 didn't have to rely on

141
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 an adversary being there to

142
00:47:40.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 challenge us, but that's changing

143
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 understand Warnock since we're going

144
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 out just on a training

145
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Mission. Most of these Torpedoes

146
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 are what are called practice

147
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 shots. They don't have actual

148
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 ordinance on them. But you

149
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 look at the green ones

150
00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 here. These are actual live

151
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 Torpedoes and anytime u.s. Submarine

152
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 goes out a port. It's

153
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 carrying at least a couple

154
00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 of these for self-defense. The

155
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 firing order is tubes five

156
00:51:40.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 and eight. the window to

157
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 five and two bait shooting

158
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 that was the huge rush

159
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 of air pressure that it

160
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 fires out in this case

161
00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 water slug at torpedo tube

162
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 full of water, but you

163
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 could feel the pressure change

164
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 in your ears not just

165
00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 down here in the torpedo

166
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 room, but throughout the entire

167
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 submarine just shows you what

168
00:55:41.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 kind of power is necessary

169
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 to get that torpedo out

170
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 of the tube. This is

171
00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 the beginning of what they

172
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 call angles and dangles a

173
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 series of steep descents and

174
00:57:41.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 a sense designed to show

175
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 the full capability of the

176
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 boat. But also to test

177
00:58:41.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 the crews Readiness you hearing

178
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 that alarm as we approach

179
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:50.000
 20° going to get to

180
00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 a 25 degree angle. Keep

181
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:21.000
 in mind. I'm standing up

182
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 straight now. What is I'm

183
01:00:41.000 --> 01:01:00.000
 leaning forward that's keeping me

184
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 vertical in relation to the

185
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:40.000
 ground. As the angle of

186
01:01:40.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 sin gets sharper. Someone asked

187
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 me today if u.s. Submarine

188
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 forces are preparing for war.

189
01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 We're not at War certainly

190
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:21.000
 not with another power that

191
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 has submarine capability. But yes,

192
01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:10.000
 they are preparing every day

193
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:30.000
 for that possibility in case

194
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.000
 it were to happen. They

195
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 want to be prepared if

196
01:05:51.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 called upon to act. Starting

197
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000
 today's roll call in a

198
01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:20.000
 Central American country between Guatemala

199
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:40.000
 and Nicaragua. We're talking about

200
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:51.000
 Honduras and it's great to

201
01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:10.000
 see everyone at Good Shepherd

202
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:31.000
 Christian Academy in zamorano to

203
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 the city of Toccoa Georgia.

204
01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 Now, we've got the Indians

205
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 watching today. Shout out to

206
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:40.000
 Stevens County high school. And

207
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:51.000
 in the US Northeast makes

208
01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:01.000
 sense. We'd make a stop

209
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 at Northeast Middle School. It's

210
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:41.000
 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania the home

211
01:12:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000
 of the Hornets. For we

212
01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 go three words Jurassic Park

213
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:31.000
 tortoise supposed to remind you

214
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:50.000
 of the movie. But instead

215
01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 of vicious Velociraptor is and

216
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 tyrannical tyrannosauruses. It's got a

217
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:51.000
 tortoise. His name's Louie. He's

218
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:10.000
 got his own pool grazing

219
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 area and Visitor Center and

220
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 if you happen to find

221
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:51.000
 yourself trapped inside with the

222
01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:01.000
 power out and nothing to

223
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:11.000
 keep you company, but a

224
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:40.000
 cold-blooded chelonian. Well, you can

225
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:50.000
 just walk to the house

226
01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:01.000
 Lewis seems to like it.

227
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000
 It's really brought him out

228
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 of it's shell and if

229
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:31.000
 you said he'd picked up

230
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 a bad habit at he'd

231
01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:01.000
 probably rep tell you to

232
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 snap it or tour tell

233
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 you to crawl away. Of

234
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:40.000
 course, no one knows for

235
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 sure, but we're certain that's

236
01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:11.000
 what his retort asst. I'm

237
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:30.000
 Carl azuz have an amazing

238
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
 weekend.
